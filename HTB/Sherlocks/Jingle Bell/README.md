## Lessons Learned:
- Using sqlitebrowser to reviewing sqlite3.db file.
- Slack Application Forensic (.DB) file.

## SCENARIO:

<p align="justify">
Torrin is suspected to be an insider threat in Forela. He is believed to have leaked some data and removed certain applications from their workstation. They managed to bypass some controls and installed unauthorised software. Despite the forensic team's efforts, no evidence of data leakage was found. As a senior incident responder, you have been tasked with investigating the incident to determine the conversation between the two parties involved.

3. Upon reviewing the DB file given, we can identify the tool used by Torrin to leak Forela's data by reviewing the `notification` table.
4. Noticed an application seems to be our interest among all 23 rows.
5. It's `slack` application.

#### NOTES:

```
Slack is a cloud-based communication platform primarily used for workplace collaboration. It allows teams tocommunicate
in real-time through channels organized by topic, as well as through direct messaging. Users can share files, integrate
with other tools and services, and search through conversations and files easily.
